# Welcome to bitbook!

**We created this website to:**

 1. Share our experiences with cryptocurrency
 2. Giving back to a community that gave to us
 3. Teach a subject, to master a subject

**This book is intended for anyone looking to *learn* about cryptocurrencies.**

This book is not intended to provide any investment advice nor represent a complete set of knowledge concerning cryptocurrencies. It's not a guide, instruction manual, or how to book and it's certainly not a book for "dummies".

**We hope this book archives the following:**

 1. A simple and easy to follow path to understanding cryptocurrencies
 2. Minimal effort on the part of the reader for maximum understanding


This book will continually be edited, updated, and refined and remain free and open to our community.

With that lets get started...
