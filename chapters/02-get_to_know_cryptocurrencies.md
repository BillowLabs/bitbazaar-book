Get To Know Cryptocurrencies
While the combindation of decentalization and cryptography are the definining characteristics of cryptocurrency, there are other interesting aspects of cryptocurrency that make it disruptive and exciting. However, there's no such thing as a free lunch, so it's important that we understand what the concequences are as well. Here are some really cool features of cryptocurrency in general:

Anonymous (mostly)
Transactions and accounts are not connected to your personal information but instead to specific address or key. This makes cryptocurrency accounts and transactions largely anonymous. However, with most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it is still possible to trace the flow of transactions for an account reducing your anonamity by some degree. This has lead to the invention of cryptocurriences like ZCash, Dash, Monero, etc. that secure their transaction history.

Irreversible
Once a Miner has confirmed a transaction - it is permanent - for all time. It can never be undone. This is different from the type of transactions most people are famailar in daily life. Most of the time, we live in a world of easy returns, account cancellations, charge-backs, and customer service professionals where mistakes are easily un-done. When working with cryptocurncies you are swimming in the deep end and once a transaction is confirmed its irreversaible.

Open
Cryptocurrencies are availiable to everyone. Regardless of your nationality, socioeconomic status, etc. you can downlaod some software and begin mining, trading, and buying cryptocurrencies. Additionally, once you have a cryptocurrency - you own it. No central authority can take it away from you. The supply of cryptocurrenies is universal, stable, and secure; though this doesn't say anything about the stability of their value.

Rapid Propagation
Because cryptocurrencies leverage peer-to-peer networks, all transaction information is rapidly propagated through out the entire network. As this is one of the things cryptocurrencies need in order to fucntion, this shouldnt come as a big supprise. However, unless you are comfortable with peer-to-peer networks its a bit alien and as a result bares repeating. Additionally, this means that as cryptocurrencies mature handling really complicated and lengthy financial transactions, quicly and securly, is a very real possibility.

Secure
Cryptocurrencies use strong cryptographics algorythims to preform transactions. This means that only the owner of a private key can make transactions. This means that cryptocurrencies are more secure than almost any other financial mechinisim availiable.

Self Representitive
Unlike the US dollar today, which reprensents debt, or the US dollar in the past, which represented gold; cryptocurencies only represent themselves. As Popeye might say, they are what they are.

Supply
Like gold or oil, most cryptocurrencies have a limited supply. They also produce new coins on a specific schedule. This has several intresting side-effects. First off, it means we can roughly calculate when the supply of new coins for a cryptocurrency will end. More importantly, it means that the supply can not be artifically increased by anyone or anything and therefore no one can control inflation or deflation by manipulating this supply. This is highly disruptive to how governments and large banks influence markets and is one of the most radical potential impacts of cryptocurrency.
