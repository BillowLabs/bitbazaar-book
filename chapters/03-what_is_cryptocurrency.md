# What is Cryptocurrency?

While the combination of decentralization and cryptography are the defining characteristics of cryptocurrency, there are other interesting aspects of cryptocurrency that make it disruptive and exciting. However, there's no such thing as a free lunch, so it's important that we understand what the consequences are as well. Here are some really cool features of cryptocurrency in general:

### Anonymous (mostly)
Transactions and accounts are not connected to your personal information but instead to specific address or key. This makes cryptocurrency accounts and transactions largely anonymous. However, with most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, it is still possible to trace the flow of transactions for an account reducing your anonymity by some degree. This has lead to the invention of cryptocurrencies like ZCash, Dash, Monero, etc. that secure their transaction history.

### Irreversible
Once a Miner has confirmed a transaction - it is permanent - for all time. It can never be undone. This is different from the type of transactions most people are familiar in daily life. Most of the time, we live in a world of easy returns, account cancellations, charge-backs, and customer service professionals where mistakes are easily un-done. When working with cryptocurrencies you are swimming in the deep end and once a transaction is confirmed its irreversible.

### Open
Cryptocurrencies are available to everyone. Regardless of your nationality, socioeconomic status, etc. you can download some software and begin mining, trading, and buying cryptocurrencies. Additionally, once you have a cryptocurrency - you own it. No central authority can take it away from you. The supply of cryptocurrencies is universal, stable, and secure; though this doesn't say anything about the stability of their value.

### Rapid Propagation
Because cryptocurrencies leverage peer-to-peer networks, all transaction information is rapidly propagated through out the entire network. As this is one of the things cryptocurrencies need in order to function, this shouldn't come as a big surprise. However, unless you are comfortable with peer-to-peer networks its a bit alien and as a result bares repeating. Additionally, this means that as cryptocurrencies mature handling really complicated and lengthy financial transactions, quickly and securely, is a very real possibility.

### Secure
Cryptocurrencies use strong cryptographic algorithms to preform transactions. This means that only the owner of a private key can make transactions. This means that cryptocurrencies are more secure than almost any other financial mechanism available.

### Self Representative
Unlike the US dollar today, which represents debt, or the US dollar in the past, which represented gold; cryptocurrencies only represent themselves. As Popeye might say, they are what they are.

### Supply
Like gold or oil, most cryptocurrencies have a limited supply. They also produce new coins on a specific schedule. This has several interesting side-effects. First off, it means we can roughly calculate when the supply of new coins for a cryptocurrency will end. More importantly, it means that the supply can not be artificially increased by anyone or anything and therefore no one can control inflation or deflation by manipulating this supply. This is highly disruptive to how governments and large banks influence markets and is one of the most radical potential impacts of cryptocurrency.
